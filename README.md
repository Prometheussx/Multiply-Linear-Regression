An implementation of multiple linear regression to predict salaries based on years of experience and age.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and use a Multiple Linear Regression model in Python. We utilize the Scikit-Learn library for regression analysis and Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation. Our goal is to predict salaries based on two independent variables: years of experience and age.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Execute the multiple_linear_regression.py script:

```bash
python multiple_linear_regression.py
```
* View the intercept and coefficients, as well as sample salary predictions.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided in multiple_linear_regression_dataset.csv. Ensure that your data file is structured similarly for proper compatibility.

## Model Details
* The project uses Scikit-Learn's LinearRegression class to build and fit the model.
* Independent variables (X): Years of experience and age.
* Dependent variable (y): Salary.
